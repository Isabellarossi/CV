I am a female Full Stack Developer/Software Engineer in training, who has had an amazing opportunity to immerse myself in the world of coding through Makers Academy's 16-week programming course.

Since I was at school, I have always enjoyed mathematics and sciences. At the same time I liked drawing and being creative. I have chosen to study BSc(Hons) Engineering Product Design at London South Bank University, as it was a perfect course for me to combine all of those interests. After graduating from LSBU, I progressed to MA Design: Product & Space at Kingston University, where I further developed my portfolio.

Following my graduation from Kingston University, I worked for Doosan Babcock, a large engineering, procurement and construction company. I initially worked on a short-term refinery project as a Translator (my native language is Polish), but as I have been very interested in all aspects of the project and due to my science and engineering background, I have been offered a permanent position with the company as a Project Engineer.

For over two years, I have worked in different world locations (UK, France, Israel), where I have been managing and planning parts of large mechanical projects. I absolutely enjoyed working in big teams of people with different skills and knowledge, however it has involved being away from home for extended periods of time.

Throughout my two degrees, I have acquired an array of design skills and as the world of product design is shifting rapidly towards service and interaction design, I am making my personal shift into the world of coding. I am hoping to make a difference by developing and designing solutions which will help improve people's lives.

## SKILLS

#### Analytical

I like order and analysis of technical subjects. I have an enquiring mind.

#### Communication

I have been told I am a good listener. I have good verbal and written communication skills. I have made many formal presentations, both during my time at the university and work.

#### Fast-Learner

I am always very keen to learn new things. During my 12-week Makers Academy course I learnt Ruby, RSpec, basics of JavaScript, Elixir and Phoenix.

#### Languages

I speak fluent English and Polish is my first language.

#### Problem-Solving

My design philosophy in regards to problem-solving is clean code, 'less is more' and keep it as simple as possible.

#### Team-Player

During my job at Doosan Babcock, I had to cooperate with many engineers and communicate with the Client on a daily basis. I have really enjoyed it and I consider myself to be an empathetic team member.
